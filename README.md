# Finland map with D3.js.

This is a Javascript app that uses D3.js to visualize geographical data.

The original maps are not included in this repository. They come from the National Land Survey of Finland. In order to use the maps they needed to be clipped with thew help of QGIS. Clipped map is included in repository.

The app has many functions. It draws three maps showing all 309 municipalities of Finland. Then it adds different data from different sources on the maps. The maps are zoomable and clickable. It took some time to make everything work and there are some wonky bits in the code.
